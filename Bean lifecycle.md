## üü¶ Spring Bean Lifecycle: Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Application Start**

* Your app starts (e.g., `SpringApplication.run(...)`).
* Spring begins initializing its IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **IoC Container Started**

* The container is ready to **load configurations** (XML, Java Config, annotations).
* Spring **scans for beans** via `@ComponentScan`, loads `@Configuration` classes.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Construct Bean**

* Spring instantiates the bean **using its constructor** (no-arg or as defined in `@Bean`).

  * This is pure Java object construction.

```java
@Component
public class MyService {
    public MyService() {
        System.out.println("Constructing MyService");
    }
}
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Inject Dependencies**

* Spring performs **Dependency Injection** (DI) for all required fields, constructor parameters, or setter methods.

```java
@Component
public class UserController {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public UserController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService; // DI happens here
    }
}
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **@PostConstruct Callback**

* After DI, Spring calls methods annotated with `@PostConstruct` (for any custom initialization).

  * Good for tasks like opening connections, initializing state, etc.

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    System.out.println("Bean initialized (custom logic here)");
}
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Use the Bean**

* The bean is now **ready for use** throughout the application: injected wherever needed, handled by the container.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **@PreDestroy Callback**

* Before the IoC container is destroyed (e.g., application shutdown), Spring calls any method annotated with `@PreDestroy` for cleanup.

  * Good for closing resources, database connections, etc.

```java
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() {
    System.out.println("Bean will be destroyed soon (cleanup here)");
}
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Bean Destroyed**

* Bean is **removed from the context** and garbage collected.

## üß¨ Full Lifecycle: Visual Mapping

| Step                  | Spring Annotation/Mechanism | Description                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Application Start     | ‚Äî                           | Start the app, load IoC container |
| IoC Container Started | ‚Äî                           | Ready to load configs, scan beans |
| Bean Constructed      | Constructor                 | Bean object is created            |
| Dependencies Injected | `@Autowired`/DI             | Dependencies are injected         |
| Custom Initialization | `@PostConstruct`            | Run initialization logic          |
| Bean In Use           | ‚Äî                           | Bean is available in the app      |
| Custom Destruction    | `@PreDestroy`               | Cleanup logic before destruction  |
| Bean Destroyed        | ‚Äî                           | Removed from context, GC-ed       |

## üß™ Code Example: All Lifecycle Phases

```java
@Component
public class LifeCycleDemo {

    public LifeCycleDemo() {
        System.out.println("1Ô∏è‚É£ Constructor: Bean Created");
    }

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService; // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dependencies injected

    @PostConstruct
    public void postConstruct() {
        System.out.println("3Ô∏è‚É£ @PostConstruct: Bean Initialized");
    }

    public void useBean() {
        System.out.println("4Ô∏è‚É£ Using the Bean");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void preDestroy() {
        System.out.println("5Ô∏è‚É£ @PreDestroy: Bean will be Destroyed");
    }
}
```

---

## üí° Advanced: Extending the Lifecycle

* **`InitializingBean` / `DisposableBean` interfaces** allow further lifecycle control.
* **`BeanPostProcessor`** lets you hook into bean creation for all beans.

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR Summary

* **Bean Lifecycle:**
  Constructor ‚Üí Dependency Injection ‚Üí `@PostConstruct` ‚Üí Use ‚Üí `@PreDestroy` ‚Üí Destroy
* **Why is this important?**
  Allows you to **safely initialize and cleanup resources** in your beans!
