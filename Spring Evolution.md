Great question! It's very common to be confused about this because **Spring** and **Spring MVC** are related, but they serve different purposes and come at different levels of abstraction.

Let me clear it up **step-by-step** like a roadmap from *Servlets ‚Üí Spring ‚Üí Spring MVC ‚Üí Spring Boot*:

---

## üö¶ 1. **First Comes Servlet**

Servlet is the **foundation** of Java web applications.

* It is part of Java EE (now Jakarta EE).
* Handles raw HTTP requests/responses.
* You manually configure URL mappings, parse request parameters, manage sessions, etc.

```java
@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) {
        res.getWriter().write("Hello World");
    }
}
```

‚û° **Low-level API**, hard to scale and test.

---

## üå± 2. **Then Comes Spring (Core)**

Spring Framework came in to **simplify enterprise Java development**.
But it‚Äôs not specific to web.

* Provides **Dependency Injection**, **Bean lifecycle**, **AOP**, **Transaction Management**, etc.
* Can be used for building CLI apps, backend services, and more.
* Spring does **not require a web layer**.

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repo;
    public UserService(UserRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
```

‚û° Spring helps you **manage business logic and wiring** between components.

---

## üåê 3. **Spring MVC comes next ‚Äì built on Servlet**

**Spring MVC** is a web framework **built on top of Servlets** and **part of Spring**.

* Uses `DispatcherServlet` (a Servlet under the hood) to handle requests.
* Supports annotations like `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`.
* Provides view resolution, form handling, exception handling, etc.

```java
@Controller
public class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Hello Spring MVC");
    }
}
```

‚û° Spring MVC = **Web layer** of the Spring Framework.

---

## üöÄ 4. **Then Comes Spring Boot**

Spring Boot is a **convention-over-configuration** layer **on top of Spring + Spring MVC**.

* Auto-configures everything.
* Embedded Tomcat/Jetty (no need to deploy to external server).
* Helps you create **production-ready Spring apps** quickly.

```java
@RestController
public class HelloRest {
    @GetMapping("/api")
    public String api() {
        return "Spring Boot Rocks!";
    }
}
```

‚û° Spring Boot = **Modern, fast way** to build apps using Spring + Spring MVC.
